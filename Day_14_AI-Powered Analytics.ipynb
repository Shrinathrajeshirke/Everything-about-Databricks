    "### 1. Databricks Genie \n",
    "- Databricks Genie is a Natural Language \"Space\" that allows business users to ask questions in plain English and get back data and visualizations.\n",
    "- How it works: Instead of writing SELECT sum(total_spend) FROM gold_table, a manager can ask, \"Who were our top 5 spenders last weekend?\"\n",
    "- The \"Magic\": Genie uses an LLM to translate that English sentence into a SQL query, runs it against your Gold table, and displays the result.\n",
    "- Your Role: As the Data Engineer, you \"curate\" the space by giving Genie instructions (like defining what a \"High-Value Customer\" is) so it doesn't make mistakes.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Mosaic AI Capabilities\n",
    "- Mosaic AI is the \"brand name\" for Databricks' entire AI suite. It is designed to help you build and deploy your own AI models (like the one we built yesterday) or use Large Language Models (LLMs).\n",
    "- Model Serving: It lets you take your ecommerce_champion_model and turn it into an API endpoint. This means a website could send customer data to the model and get a spend prediction back in milliseconds.\n",
    "- Vector Search: If you wanted to build a \"Recommendation Bot,\" Mosaic AI can store your product descriptions as \"vectors\" (mathematical maps) to find similar items for customers.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Generative AI Integration\n",
    "- This is about bringing the power of models like Llama 3 or GPT-4 directly into your data warehouse.\n",
    "- AI Functions: Databricks allows you to use SQL to call an AI.\n",
    "- Example: You can run a command like SELECT ai_analyze_sentiment(review_text) to automatically categorize millions of customer reviews as \"Happy\" or \"Angry\" without writing a single line of ML code.\n",
    "- RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation): This is the gold standard for GenAI. It allows an LLM to answer questions using only your e-commerce data, ensuring the AI doesn't \"hallucinate\" or lie.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. AI-Assisted Analysis\n",
    "- This is how AI helps you, the developer, work faster within Databricks.\n",
    "- Assistant in the Editor: You've probably noticed the \"Assistant\" button in your notebook. \n",
    "- It can help you fix errors (like the RestException we solved yesterday), explain complex code, or even write the starting code for a visualization.\n",
    "- Automated Insights: Databricks SQL can automatically scan your tables and suggest \"insights\"—it might pop up a notification saying, \"Hey, I noticed sales in the Electronics category dropped 20% on Tuesdays.\""
