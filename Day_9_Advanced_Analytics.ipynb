    "- In the Databricks, SQL Warehouses are the specialized compute resources designed specifically for SQL analysts and BI tools. \n",
    "- While you’ve been using \"All-Purpose Clusters\" for your notebooks, SQL Warehouses are the high-performance engines used for the \"Gold\" layer of your project.\n",
    "- Think of a SQL Warehouse as a professional kitchen: it is pre-stocked and optimized specifically for one task (running SQL queries) with zero distractions.\n",
    "- Key Features: Why Use a Warehouse?\n",
    "- Photon Engine: Every SQL Warehouse is powered by Photon, a vectorized query engine written in C++ that makes your SELECT statements and aggregations run up to 3x–5x faster than standard Spark.\n",
    "- Serverless Options: Unlike clusters that take 3–5 minutes to start, Serverless SQL Warehouses spin up in about 2–6 seconds. They are managed by Databricks, so you don't worry about VM configuration.\n",
    "- T-Shirt Sizing: You don't pick CPU or RAM. You pick a size (2X-Small, Small, Medium, etc.).\n",
    "- Auto-Stop: They are aggressive about saving money. A serverless warehouse can be set to turn off after just 1 minute of inactivity.\n",
    "- SQL Warehouses vs. All-Purpose Clusters\n",

    "\n",
    "**The 3-Step Build Process**\n",
    "- **1. Define Your Data (The Data Tab)**\n",
    "- Before you draw a chart, you need to tell the dashboard what data to look at. \n",
    "- You can point it directly to the tables.\n",
    "- Best Practice: Don't use SELECT *. Only bring in the columns you need for the chart (e.g., event_date, brand, total_revenue). This keeps the dashboard snappy even with millions of rows.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **2. Create Visualizations (The Canvas Tab)**\n",
    "- Click Add a Visualization and choose your type.\n",
    "- Time Series (Line Chart): Show daily revenue trends.\n",
    "- Bar Chart: Compare top 10 brands by sales.\n",
    "- Counter: A big, bold number showing \"Total Sales This Month.\"\n",
    "- Funnel: Show the drop-off from view → add_to_cart → purchase.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **3. Add Interactivity (Filters)**\n",
    "- This is the most important part for your users. Add a Date Range filter and a Category dropdown at the top. When the Marketing Manager selects \"Electronics,\" every chart on the dashboard will instantly update to show only that data.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Sharing & Governance:** \n",
    "- Dashboards respect permissions. When you click Publish, you have two choices:\n",
    "- Run as Viewer (Individual Permissions): The user can only see data they have SELECT access to in Unity Catalog.\n",
    "- Run as Owner (Shared Permissions): The user sees the data through your eyes. This is useful if you want to show a summary to someone who doesn't have access to the raw tables."

    "**1. Choosing the Right Visualizations**\n",
