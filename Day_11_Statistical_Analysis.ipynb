    "- **Mean vs. Median (50%):** If the Mean is much higher than the Median, you have a few very expensive \"outlier\" products pulling the average up.\n",
    "- **Min/Max:** If Min is negative or zero, you might have data errors (unless they are \"refund\" events).\n",

    "- Mean (Average): The sum of all prices divided by the count.\n",
